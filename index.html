  <h1>Concepts of the Web</h1>
  <h2>How the web works</h2>

  <b>HTTP</b>
  <p>The web consists of computers that talk to each other over the Internet. The computers talk to each other with a protocol called <em>http</em>.
  The end user's computer runs a <em>web browser</em> which is responsible for requesting documents from servers, which store them, and displaying the contents to the user.
  The user's computer sends a document request to the server using the <em>http</em> protocol.
  When the server receives the request, it looks for the document and returns it to the user also using the <em>http</em> protocol. A good example video of how this works can be found here:
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video explains the process</a>.
  </p>

  <b>HTML</b>
  <p>The primary document type that makes up the web is called a HTML document.
  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to control the way the document is displayed to the user.
  The user's computer reads the document and displays it as described by the HTML code.
  The HTML document consists of content to be displayed as well as instructions on <em>how</em> to display the content.
  A good overview of HTML documents can be seen in <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">

  </p>

  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>HTML documents consists of various parts, but they primarily consist of instructions on how to format the content,
    called <em>tags</em> and the content itelf. This combination of tags and content is often referred to as an
    <em>Element</em>.
    A tag is used to tell the browser how to treat the contents as well as providing a means to link
    to external content not contained in the document itself.
    Tags and elements are explained in more detail in
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">this video</a>.
  Referring to external content is a powerful way to create interesting and dynamic pages that can display videos
  or play music.
  </p>

  <b>Computers are stupid</b>
  <p>Computers only follow intstructions as provided to them. They intepret the instructions literally, so even very
    small mistakes in those instructions can cause unexpected behavior.
  </p>

  <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  <p>HTML elements have two primary distinguishing characteristics that allow certain degrees of control.
  An <em>Inline</em> element is basic item that is usually rendered similar to ordinary text. A <em>Block</em> element,
   however, forms a sort of invisible block around the content such that it can be formatted in various ways.
